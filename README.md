# üîç Spreadsheet Semantic Search Engine

A powerful semantic search engine that understands spreadsheet content conceptually, allowing users to find information using natural language queries instead of cell references or keyword matching.

## üåü Features

### üß† Semantic Understanding
- **Business Concept Recognition**: Understands revenue, costs, margins, ratios, forecasts, etc.
- **Synonym Handling**: Recognizes "sales" = "revenue", "profit" = "earnings", etc.
- **Context Interpretation**: Understands formulas in business context
- **Formula Semantics**: Analyzes SUM, AVERAGE, conditional formulas, etc.

### üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Queries
- **Conceptual Queries**: "Find all profitability metrics", "Show cost calculations"
- **Functional Queries**: "Show percentage calculations", "Find average formulas"  
- **Comparative Queries**: "Budget vs actual analysis", "Time series data"

### üéØ Intelligent Results
- **Semantic Relevance**: Results ranked by conceptual similarity
- **Business Context**: Explanations of why results match your query
- **Rich Output**: Shows concept names, locations, formulas, and explanations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
```bash
mkdir spreadsheet-search && cd spreadsheet-search
# Copy all the provided files into this directory
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the web interface**
```bash
python main.py
```

4. **Open your browser**
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage Options

### 1. Web Interface (Recommended)
The web interface provides an intuitive way to test the semantic search:

```bash
python main.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and:
1. Click "Load Sample Financial Data"
2. Try the suggested queries or enter your own
3. View results with detailed explanations

### 2. Command Line Interface
For developers who prefer CLI:

```bash
# Interactive mode
python cli_demo.py --mode interactive

# Batch mode with custom queries
python cli_demo.py --mode batch --queries "find margins" "show growth rates"
```

## üß™ Sample Queries to Try

### Profitability Analysis
- "find profitability metrics"
- "show margin calculations" 
- "where is EBITDA"
- "profit analysis"

### Cost Analysis  
- "show cost calculations"
- "find expense data"
- "operating costs"

### Growth & Performance
- "where are my growth rates"
- "find efficiency ratios"
- "performance metrics"
- "YoY analysis"

### Formula Analysis
- "show percentage calculations"
- "find average formulas"
- "what conditional calculations exist"
- "lookup formulas"

### Comparative Analysis
- "budget vs actual analysis"
- "variance analysis"
- "time series data"

### How It Works

1. **Content Processing**: Extracts and analyzes spreadsheet data
2. **Concept Mapping**: Maps cells to business concepts using domain knowledge
3. **Semantic Embeddings**: Creates vector representations of content
4. **Query Processing**: Analyzes natural language queries
5. **Intelligent Matching**: Combines semantic similarity with business logic
6. **Result Ranking**: Ranks results by relevance and context

## üîß Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **FastAPI**: Modern web framework for the API
- **Sentence Transformers**: For semantic embeddings
- **Pandas/OpenPyXL**: Spreadsheet processing
- **Scikit-learn**: Similarity calculations
- **Pydantic**: Data validation

### Business Concepts Supported
- **Profitability**: Margins, ROI, EBITDA, profit calculations
- **Revenue**: Sales, income, growth rates, recurring revenue
- **Costs**: COGS, OpEx, expenses, cost analysis
- **Efficiency**: Ratios, productivity, asset utilization
- **Growth**: YoY, QoQ, CAGR, trend analysis
- **Formulas**: Percentages, averages, conditionals, lookups

## üìä Test Data

The system comes with comprehensive sample data including:
- **Financial Model**: P&L statements, cash flow, KPIs
- **Revenue Analysis**: Sales data, growth rates, margins
- **Expense Dashboard**: Cost breakdown, ROI calculations
- **Budget Analysis**: Variance analysis, performance tracking

## üéØ Key Advantages Over Keyword Search

| Traditional Search | Semantic Search |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Find "margin" text | Understands profit margins, EBITDA margins, etc. |
| Exact formula matches | Interprets formula business meaning |
| Cell reference based | Business concept focused |
| No context understanding | Rich business context |

## üß™ Testing Examples

### Query: "find profitability metrics"
**Results:**
- Gross Profit Margin (Revenue Analysis!C14) - Direct margin calculation
- EBITDA Margin (KPI Dashboard!B6) - Operating efficiency measure
- Operating Margin (P&L Statement!D23) - Core profitability metric

### Query: "budget vs actual analysis"  
**Results:**
- Budget vs Actual Analysis sheet - Variance calculations
- Performance variance metrics - Budget comparison formulas
- Actual vs Budget Revenue - Revenue variance analysis

## üîÆ Advanced Features

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Business Concepts
Extend `business_concepts.py`:

BusinessConcept(
    name="customer_lifetime_value",
    synonyms=["CLV", "lifetime value", "customer value"],
    keywords=["customer", "lifetime", "value", "clv"],
    description="Total value of customer relationship",
    category="customer_metrics"
)
```

### Custom Query Processing
Modify `semantic_search.py` to add domain-specific logic:

```python
def _process_custom_query(self, query: str) -> str:
    # Add your custom query enhancement logic
    pass
```
